Just type checkup in a shell amd follow the prompts.

Introduction
============
Checkup will look for a kernel pkg when you update, if it finds one it will look for an 
Nvidia pkg. If one is found it will update normally ,if no Nvidia pkg is found it will 
give you the option to either, skip the update entirely, update while skipping the kernel
pkg(s), update everything and then automatically build an Nvidia pkg useing Bauerbill 
or you can update normally (Although obviously this defeats the whole purpose of the 
program). If no kernel pkg is found it will update mormally , whether or not there is an
Nvidia update.
	Also while performing any update you are given the option to ignore any packages 
that are due to update.

Requirements
=============
Pacman-color, Bauerbill, Sudo
